## Class Assignment - Input Validation (Client & Server Side)

[form.html](form.html)

I have done a html part where user can input the intended data in this html file. This file have linked with [form.css](form.css) and [form.js](form.js) where the style and regex expression have been in this file also. In this [form.html](form.html) file, i have put the input validation in within the form for each attribute of name,matric number etc.. which it called as pattern for the regular expression. I have tried to put each expression to fit the desired input and also prevent any injection occured when user try to do so.

[process_form.php](process_form.php)

For this php file, it is used to be our output where it will retrive the data from data input in [form.html](form.html).

[form.js](form.js)

For this file, I have also put regex where it will act as second defensive part for server side input validation.

## Thank you!
